# Telecom Data User Behavior & Experience Analysis

This project involves analyzing customer behavior and user experience in a telecom dataset using various data analysis, machine learning, and clustering techniques. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, engagement, and experience metrics that can help improve service quality and user satisfaction in the telecommunications industry.

### Project Overview
This project utilizes real-world telecom data to provide a comprehensive analysis of user behavior, engagement, and experience. The tasks performed include exploratory data analysis (EDA), univariate and bivariate analysis, correlation analysis, clustering using k-means, and dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A dashboard was also created for visual insights, and a machine learning model was used to predict user satisfaction based on engagement and experience metrics.

Data Preparation
The dataset includes user xDR sessions, session durations, download/upload data, handset types, and network performance metrics. Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, detecting outliers, normalizing engagement metrics, and transforming variables into deciles for analysis.

Data Source: Telecom xDR records (call and data sessions).

### Analysis Techniques
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To identify trends, missing values, and outliers.
Univariate Analysis: Distribution and dispersion metrics for each quantitative variable.
Bivariate Analysis: Analysis of relationships between variables such as applications and data usage.
Correlation Analysis: Correlation matrix between Social Media, Google, Email, YouTube, Netflix, Gaming, and Other data.
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA for reducing data dimensions.
Models Used
K-Means Clustering: Applied to group users into different clusters based on engagement, experience, and satisfaction scores.
Regression Models: Used to predict user satisfaction based on engagement and experience metrics.

#### Results
The results of the analysis include:

Top 10 handsets and top handset manufacturers.
Clustering of users based on engagement and experience.
PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Regression model to predict satisfaction scores.
Dashboard visualization of key insights.
